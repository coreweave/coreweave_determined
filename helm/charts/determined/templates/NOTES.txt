Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}. Your release is named: {{ .Release.Name }}.
It may take several minutes for your deployment to start up.

You have configured Determined to deploy the master with a Ingress attached. 


The IP address of the Determined master is the ClusterIP of determined-master-service-{{ .Release.Name }},
which you can lookup by running (it may take a few minutes for the ip address to be assigned):

kubectl get service determined-master-service-{{ .Release.Name }} -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

Once you have the IP address, configure master address locally by running: `export DET_MASTER=<ClusterIP>:{{ .Values.masterPort }}`.

To submit experiments please install the Determined CLI locally: `pip install determined`.
